# rag-ai-assistant
RAG AI Assistant is a modular system for advanced document-based Q&amp;A. It uses a vector database (PostgreSQL + pgvector) for fast, context-aware search and supports multiple chat/embedding models. A document pipeline cleans and converts DOCX/TXTfiles for embedding, but the main focus is on AI-powered question answering.
